Key Findings
Weather Impact
Poor visibility and precipitation correlate with higher accident severity

Rain and fog increase risk of severe accidents

Clear weather has the most accidents but typically lower severity

Infrastructure Effects
Traffic signals and crossings influence accident severity and frequency

Urban areas show concentrated accident hotspots

Temporal Patterns
Peak accident times align with rush hours

Seasonal effects impact accident frequency

Data Processing
Data cleaning for missing values, duplicates, and outliers

Feature engineering: timestamp conversions, categorical coding

Comprehensive preprocessing for analysis readiness
