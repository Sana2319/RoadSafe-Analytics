## Project Overview

This project presents a comprehensive data science analysis of **US Road Accident Data (2016â€“2023)** using more than **7 million accident records**.
The goal is to uncover hidden trends, evaluate risk factors, and visualize how different elements such as weather, infrastructure, and time influence accident severity.

By leveraging data-driven insights, this project aims to support traffic safety improvements, informed policymaking, and public awareness.

---

## Purpose

* Identify **key patterns and risk factors** contributing to road accidents.
* Support **data-driven decision-making** in traffic management and safety initiatives.
* Deliver **insightful visualizations** for policymakers and researchers.
* Encourage the development of **preventive strategies** to reduce accident rates.

---

## Features

### Core Analytical Components

* **Univariate Analysis:** Explore the distribution of key variables (e.g., severity, time, weather).
* **Bivariate Analysis:** Study relationships between accident factors.
* **Multivariate Analysis:** Use correlation and dimensionality reduction (PCA) to reveal deeper trends.
* **Geospatial Mapping:** Identify high-risk regions and accident hotspots.
* **Temporal Insights:** Analyze patterns across days, months, and seasons.

### Visualization Capabilities

* Interactive heatmaps
* Geographic accident plotting
* Statistical distribution plots
* Correlation matrices
* Time series visualizations

## Key Findings

### Weather Impact

* Accidents increase significantly in **rainy, foggy, and snowy** conditions.
* **Poor visibility** correlates strongly with higher severity levels.
* **Clear weather** sees more frequent accidents but with lower severity.

### Infrastructure Influence

* **Traffic signals, crossings, and urban intersections** contribute heavily to accident density.
* **Urban clusters** show more frequent but less severe accidents compared to rural zones.

### Temporal Patterns

* Peak hours correspond to **morning and evening rush times**.
* **Seasonal variations** show increased incidents during winter and rainy months.

---

## Data Processing

* Removal of **duplicates** and handling **missing values**.
* Conversion of timestamps into **dateâ€“time features** (hour, weekday, season).
* Encoding categorical variables for compatibility with analysis.
* Creation of **engineered features** (e.g., visibility levels, weather categories).
